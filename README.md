This project aims to create a simple program, that allows users to explore the Mandelbrot Set in an interactive GUI.

The code uses the following libraries:
  - the python standard library (os, decimal, sys, time, tkinter, threading)
  - pygame

# Keybinds:
 - W, A, S, D : Move up, left, down, and right
 - Q, E: Zoom In, Out
 - N, M: Change Color
 - Up, Down Arrow: Increase and Decrease Iterations
 - Left, Right Arrow: Decrease and Increase resolution

 - R: Reset position
 - I: Low resolution mode
 - SpaceBar key: High resolution render
 - 0 key: Decimal Precision Mode (required at quite high zoom levels)
 - Ctrl + S keys: Save image to `\saves` folder

# Releases:
"Frozen" exe versions of the python program are available in the releases tab as zipped folders.

In some cases, the exe may display a smartscreen warning when started. Users are requested to ignore the warning, as it simply indicates that the file has not been certificated by Microsoft. The files do not contain any malicious code.

# Installation:
 - The file (the latest release is recommended) should be downloaded from the releases tab in github.
