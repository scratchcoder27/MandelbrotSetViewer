# MandelExplorer

This project aims to create a simple program, that allows users to explore the Mandelbrot Set in an interactive GUI.

The code uses the following libraries:
  - the python standard library (os, decimal, sys, time, tkinter, threading)
  - pygame

# Releases:
"Frozen" exe versions of the python program are available in the releases tab as zipped folders.

In some cases, the exe may display a smartscreen warning when started. Users are requested to ignore the warning, as it simply indicates that the file has not been certificated by Microsoft. The files do not contain any malicious code.

# Installation:
 - The file (the latest release is recommended) should be downloaded from the releases tab in github.

 - The file should be unzipped (Extract all in windows) to the destination desired.
